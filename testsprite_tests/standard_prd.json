  "product_overview": "The Accessibility Companion is an AI-powered accessibility layer that enhances existing websites to be usable by people with various disabilities, including vision, hearing, motor, and cognitive challenges. It integrates real-time speech-to-text, text-to-speech, hand gesture recognition, text formatting with dyslexia-friendly fonts and color themes, and voice command features, aiming to make the web universally accessible.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable real-time speech-to-text transcription for deaf and hard-of-hearing users.",
    "Provide intelligent text-to-speech capabilities for blind and low vision users.",
    "Detect and classify hand gestures to allow motor-disabled users to control web interfaces hands-free.",
    "Offer text formatting options including dyslexia-friendly fonts, adjustable font sizes, spacing, and high contrast color themes for cognitive accessibility.",
    "Support voice commands for basic website interaction and navigation.",
    "Create an intuitive and responsive user interface accessible on desktop and mobile browsers.",
    "Deliver all features as a client-side web app with optional backend APIs for speech recognition and gesture processing."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Real-Time Speech-to-Text with live transcript panel using Google Speech-to-Text API.",
    "Text-to-Speech capability with selectable voice options, speed control, and text highlighting during playback.",
    "Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe and custom heuristics to detect five common gestures and map them to web actions like click, scroll, pause, and play.",
    "Voice Command Parser to handle common commands such as 'click', 'scroll down/up', and 'read this' with simple keyword matching.",
    "Text Formatting and Simplification including dyslexia-friendly fonts, adjustable font size, line and letter spacing, and multiple high contrast color themes.",
    "Accessibility Toolbar providing toggles and settings for all features in a unified UI accessible on multiple devices.",
    "Fully responsive and accessible UI components built with React and Tailwind CSS."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User launches the Accessibility Companion web app or extension.",
    "User selects a mode or feature from the accessibility toolbar: Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, Hand Gesture Recognition, or Text Formatting.",
    "For Speech-to-Text, user enables microphone access, speaks, and sees real-time transcription on screen with options to copy or save.",
    "For Text-to-Speech, user selects text on any webpage and uses the tool to listen to it, adjusting voice speed and type as needed.",
    "For Hand Gesture Recognition, user grants camera access and performs gestures which the system detects and maps to website navigation actions with on-screen visual feedback.",
    "Users customize text formatting options to improve readability, choosing fonts, sizes, spacing, and color themes.",
    "Voice commands can be spoken and parsed to interact with the website for basic control.",
    "Settings persist during the session and can be saved, with fallback and demo modes available during errors or outages."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Speech-to-Text transcriptions appear in real-time with over 85% accuracy on typical speech samples.",
    "Text-to-Speech reads selected text aloud with correct voice and speed settings and highlights text during playback.",
    "Hand Gesture Recognition accurately detects and classifies at least 5 gestures with confidence above 80%, triggering mapped actions reliably.",
    "Voice commands are parsed correctly for predefined keywords and produce expected interface responses.",
    "Text formatting applies correctly and changes reflect immediately on the webpage, improving readability for dyslexic and cognitive users.",
    "API endpoints for gesture detection and command execution respond within 200ms under normal load.",
    "The UI components are fully responsive, accessible (keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly), and pass WCAG contrast guidelines.",
    "All features handle errors gracefully with fallback modes or demo data to maintain usability during failures."
