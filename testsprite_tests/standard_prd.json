  "product_overview": "Accessibility AI is a comprehensive web application leveraging AI technologies to enhance digital accessibility for all users, including those with visual, hearing, and communication impairments. The platform integrates real-time AI-powered features such as voice navigation, screen reading, sign language recognition, and adaptive visual enhancements via an interactive dashboard and secure authentication.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide advanced AI-driven accessibility tools for visually impaired, hearing impaired, and sign language users.",
    "Offer seamless and secure user authentication and profile management.",
    "Enable real-time interaction with accessibility aids using low-latency AI processing.",
    "Visualize accessibility statistics and compliance metrics via an intuitive dashboard.",
    "Ensure robust security compliance including JWT authentication, rate limiting, and input validation."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "AI-Powered Bento Box delivering voice navigation, screen reader AI, accurate real-time captions, and sign language translation.",
    "Multi-modal accessibility including Blind Mode with object detection and text-to-speech feedback, Deaf Mode with speech-to-text and sound event detection, and Sign Language Interpreter using vision-based gesture recognition.",
    "Interactive dashboard for mode selection, accessibility statistics, and trend visualization with Recharts.",
    "Secure authentication flow supporting registration, login, JWT token-based sessions, and multi-factor security.",
    "Responsive UI developed with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with Framer Motion animations.",
    "Backend architecture combining Node.js Express API with Python Flask services for advanced gesture processing and AI integration.",
    "Security features including password hashing with bcrypt, helmet and CORS middleware, and brute-force protection."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User lands on home page and navigates to Join Us via Navbar to register/login.",
    "Upon successful authentication, user accesses the Dashboard to select modes and view accessibility metrics.",
    "User interacts with AI-powered Bento Box feature cards to engage voice navigation, screen reader, captions, or sign language translator.",
    "In Blind Mode, system detects objects visually and provides spoken feedback.",
    "In Deaf Mode, system transcribes speech to text and detects environmental sounds in real-time.",
    "In Sign Language Mode, the system uses webcam input for gesture recognition and translates signs to text output.",
    "User can manage profile and accessibility preferences through Settings Dropdown accessible from Navbar."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All accessibility modes must accurately perform AI-powered detection and translation functions with minimal latency.",
    "Authentication processes must securely manage JWT tokens and protect against brute-force attacks.",
    "Dashboard must correctly display real-time accessibility statistics and trends with no visual or data errors.",
    "All UI components must be responsive and accessible according to WCAG guidelines.",
    "Backend API endpoints must validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.",
    "End-to-end integration between Node.js backend and Python gesture service must be reliable with consistent API response times."
